# GIFNet: Gender-Independent Kinship Verification Network via Fuzzy Disentangling and Multi-metric Inference

Official implementation of **"Gender-independent Kinship Verification Network Via Fuzzy Disentangling and Multi-metric Inference"**.

## 📖 Abstract
This repository contains the implementation of GIFNet, a novel kinship verification framework that achieves gender-independent performance through fuzzy feature disentanglement and multi-metric inference mechanisms.

## ✨ Features
- **Gender-Independent Architecture**: Robust kinship verification across gender combinations
- **Fuzzy Disentangling**: Separates gender-related features from kinship features
- **Multi-Metric Inference**: Combines multiple similarity metrics for accurate verification
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete training and inference workflow

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
pip install opencv-python pillow
