Official PyTorch implementation of **"Gender-independent Kinship Verification Network Via Fuzzy Disentangling and Multi-metric Inference"**.

## 📖 Abstract
This repository contains the implementation of GIFNet, a novel kinship verification framework that achieves gender-independent performance through fuzzy feature disentanglement and multi-metric inference mechanisms.

## ✨ Features
- **Gender-Independent Architecture**: Robust kinship verification across all gender combinations
- **Fuzzy Disentangling Module**: Separates gender-related features from kinship features
- **Multi-Metric Inference**: Combines multiple similarity metrics for enhanced accuracy
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete training, validation, and inference workflow
- **Swin Transformer Backbone**: Leverages hierarchical vision transformer architecture
